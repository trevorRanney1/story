      <p id = "first">He ran towards Kervin; arms facing straight forward, hands open, eyes locked at his target. It was like a wild animal lunging for prey, except it was just Nadeem about to assault someone. Kervin pulled a hatchet out from his back pocket and swung it violently at Nadeem. Nadeem stopped in his tracks once he saw this and began to run. “A HATCHET?”, he thought. “Since when did he have THAT?”</p>
      <p>Nadeem ran to his room and locked the door. He knew Kervin might pull a Shining on him so he rushed to turn on his phone and call the cops. It was dead. He conveniently had a landline in his room mostly for looks and he ran to get it. Sadly, Nadeem forgot the police’s phone number, why would they make it so complicated? Nadeem called the only number he could think of.  “(774) 849-2218”. This is my number. I was in Florida at the time with my friend Papyrus searching for my dog named Paul. I sadly never found him. I still think that Steven and the Nameless King stole him. Nadeem sounded horrified over the phone, and he explained the scenario. Sadly, it was night, I was tired from searching for Paul, and I didn’t have the energy to care. I hung up. Yeah, it was careless, but I was tired and I wasn’t thinking straight. So tired that I didn’t even comprehend yet what was really going on. I only realized what a terrible decision it was the next morning when I had my thoughts straight.</p>
      <p>Nadeem didn’t know what to do. He could hear the door being broken down. Like a timer ticking down: with every hack at the door he knew his time was running out. Once a hole was broken into the door Kervin missed the opportunity to say “Here’s Kervin” but instead said “I am going to slaughter you with the blade of this hatchet and you will burst into chunks of blood-covered flesh.” This was still just as intimidating towards Nadeem.</p>
      <p>As Kervin approached Nadeem, Nadeem felt something deep down inside resonating. This is the power of determination. Determination of the invisible force of power used in the video game UNDERTALE. Nadeem had a red soul, and thus could use this power to change the outcome of the event. Nadeem Sassin stood before Kervin and hit him bluntly in the head with a broom. This fractured Kervin’s skull. It hurt, but Kervin had felt pain worse than this. Luckily for Kervin, he also had something formidable. Kervin had a sick battle theme. Using this battle theme Nadeem started jamming out. While Nadeem was distracted, Kervin attacked. Kervin also had a huge attack stat. Nadeem was almost attracted to Kervin’s buffed out stats, but he didn’t want this to turn into a romance novel. With every slash, Nadeem felt weaker and weaker. His determination was not enough.</p>
