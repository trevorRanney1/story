      <p id = "first">Kervin materialized in Nadeem’s bedroom. He saw the starry sky above him, he appreciated its beauty more than ever in this moment. When Kervin stood, he knew not to encounter Nadeem. Nadeem could have his victory, Kervin didn’t want to restart the fight. It would simply be too risky. He also noticed a remote next to him, it had a big red button on it; most likely to return to the afterlife, but there were more buttons with unknown meaning. Kervin assumed not to touch these.</p>
      <p>Kervin crept down Nadeem’s stairs. He saw Nadeem standing there dancing with joy. At least Nadeem was happy with his victory. Looking at Nadeem from afar though, Kervin felt almost enraged. He tried to hold back from restarting something unwanted, but he had a sudden urge.</p>
      <img class = "story1" src = "images/party.png" alt = "Nadeem is having a grand ol' time.">
      <p>Nadeem Sassin froliced across his living room. Nadeem had never felt happier. He had conquered possible death. Even with this, Nadeem felt a little on-edge. He heard some kind of breathing behind him. Suddenly, he was tackled by Kervin himself. “How are you alive???” Nadeem asked. “I HAVE NO CLUE!!” Kervin screamed, “BUT I’M GONNA USE WHAT TIME I HAVE LEFT TO OBLITERATE YOU!”</p>
      <p>Nadeem was struck with shock. He could barely move. He heard his doorbell though, and got up to answer it. Kervin allowed this, it would be rude not to. It was Nadeem’s Golden CCGameing figurine! Nadeem was thrilled. He saw the sharpened spear that CCGameing was holding, and snuck the figure in his back pocket. He saw a possible use for this. Nadeem Sassin entered the living room, got into his tackled position, and resumed the fight.</p>
      <p>Kervin threw powerful attacks at Nadeem but Nadeem stood though them. Nadeem couldn’t handle it for long though so he had to think of another plan. He was out of most options with only two left though, and didn’t yet want to go to his last resort, so he got out his CCGameing figure, and shoved it at Kervin.</p>
      <p>Bloodshed. The spear impaled Kervin. Kervin’s face went pale and his eyes turned a ghostly fog-color. Nevertheless.. he withstood. He hadn’t gone this far for nothing. He ripped the CCGameing figurine straight from his chest and let out a ghastly shriek. Kervin was a husk of his former self and only knew vengeance.</p>
